# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts student performance based on study hours, attendance, and past scores using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).

## Project Overview
- Uses Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis and model training.
- Helps educators predict student scores based on their study habits.
- Visualizes data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Data analysis and Machine Learning)
- Pandas and NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression model)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Code execution)

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Study_Hours → Number of hours spent studying.
- Attendance → Student attendance percentage.
- Past_Scores → Scores from previous exams.
- Final_Score → The actual final exam score (Target variable).

## Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.5
- R² Score: 0.92 (Good model accuracy)
